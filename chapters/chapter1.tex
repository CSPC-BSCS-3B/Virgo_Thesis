\begin{refsection}

This chapter provides an overview of the study, covering the challenges of the campus library, the study’s objectives, and its significance. It defines the problem, outlines research goals, and highlights the proposed system’s potential impact. The scope and limitations clarify its boundaries, while the project dictionary and notes offer essential terms and supporting details. 

\section{Background of the Problem}

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT \cite{achiam2023gpt}  and gemini \cite{lee2025gemini} have made significant advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by excelling in diverse tasks such as semantic search, classification, and clustering, providing more accurate, context-aware results than keyword-based approaches.
\cite{nijkamp2022codegen,chen2021evaluating} In addition, these advancements have benefited various fields, including academic research. However, LLM responses can depend heavily on the data on which the model was trained, and they cannot retrieve real-time or external information beyond their pre-trained knowledge. This makes them less effective for tasks that require up-to-date, specific institutional data, such as retrieving current academic resources in university libraries \cite{liu2024information}.

\bigbreak
Writing an academic paper requires a deep understanding of the subject and a significant amount of related literature for credible evidence, which can be challenging and time-consuming \cite{khalifa2024using}. It is essential to first visit the university library to search and gather existing related literature significant to the researcher’s study.  However, most libraries today still operate in traditional, non-digital formats where materials are only accessible on-site, making the process of finding and retrieving resources more difficult. 

Furthermore, some school libraries offer limited access and prohibit users from taking home thesis papers. These challenges significantly delay the progress of future academic research due to limited access to relevant literature in university libraries \cite{prajapat2022comparative}. 

\bigbreak
To address retrieval issues, several universities in the Philippines have recognized the importance of adopting digital archiving systems to improve academic access. This becomes more evident in the last previous year before covid-19 pandemic, when researchers were unable to access library resources, prompting libraries to adapt and make resources accessible even remotely. However, digitalization alone does not fully solve the problem \cite{aydin2021comparing, lagas2023challenges, prajapat2022comparative}. Unfortunately, most digitalized libraries today still use outdated search systems that need an exact keyword search, which can result in irrelevant materials \cite{setiyani2023increasing}. The current search mechanism of this digital archives including the Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC) library still heavily depends on traditional keyword-matching algorithms. If users do not input the exact title or precise keywords, the system returns "not found" even when relevant content exists. This limitation highlights a deeper issue in search functionality, where vague or topic-based queries cannot retrieve appropriate materials, thereby hindering access to valuable research. This inefficiency in retrieval presents a serious barrier for the academe community,  particularly when conducting time-sensitive or exploratory academic work.

\bigbreak
These challenges of university libraries in the Philippines, including the CSPC library, have shared difficulties in accessing academic resources, outdated search systems, and ineffective information retrieval that affect the efficiency of academic research. While numerous studies have also explored the integration of the emerging LLM-powered chatbots in academic research \cite{aboelmaged2024conversational}, their implementation and effect for thesis retrieval in specific university libraries, including CSPC, have not been established. This is primarily due to the limitations of LLMs, which rely solely on pre-trained knowledge and are unable to access or utilize the unique local archives maintained by individual libraries \cite{bommasani2021opportunities, strich2024improving}.

\bigbreak
To overcome these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a superior approach \cite{lewis2020retrieval}. Unlike standalone LLMs, which require retraining and additional domain-specific data to adjust LLM weights, RAG presents an advanced approach by retrieving relevant external information to generate responses and holds significant practical implications for university libraries by improving search functionalities. Additionally, RAG ensures that the most relevant academic resources are retrieved quickly and straightforwardly, making it suitable for libraries with expansive collections of academic papers that are difficult for researchers and students to navigate \cite{wang2024mememo, huang2023retrieval}.

\bigbreak
This thesis developed an enhanced LLM-powered chatbot with the integration of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to improve information retrieval, especially in literature search and thesis retrieval of university-owned thesis PDFs at the Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC) Library. This chatbot application generates answers and retrieve relevant documents based on the user's prompt.


\section{Statement of the Problem}

Finding relevant thesis literature in a University's library, such as in CSPC, can be challenging. Many researchers in the academic community struggle to find the exact thesis paper they need, often requiring them to travel and physically visit the library just to retrieve specific documents.

\bigbreak
Currently, CSPC’s library website [25] only allows users to search by exact document title. Finding relevant research becomes difficult if users don’t know the exact title. Furthermore, library policies restrict users from taking thesis books outside the premises, limiting accessibility to essential academic resources.  In response to these challenges, this study aims to explore creating a chatbot that eliminates those limitations by enabling searches based on topics, keywords, or even vague descriptions. Additionally, we aim to make this available everywhere.

\section{Scope and Limitation}

The scope of this study is to develop a chatbot for the Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC) library, utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Google Gemini LLM. The goal is to address the challenges faced by the academic community in searching and retrieving thesis literature by replacing the current yet traditional keyword-based search with a more conversational and topic-oriented approach. This will be done through a website based with an access control where admin can upload new published pdf thesis and users can register through their cspc email. Additionally, we aim to deploy this on a local server. This project will be conducted over two whole semesters, allowing ample time for development and testing.

\bigbreak
There are certain limitations to consider in this study. First, our team will focus only on utilizing the available PDF copies of undergraduate theses that have already been published. Second, the chatbot’s accuracy will depend on the quality and structure of thesis records, and on the clarity and relevance of the user's prompts. Additionally, hardware limitations may constrain computational efficiency, which could affect the chatbot’s real-time processing capabilities. Finally, while the RAG technique can reduce hallucination, users are advised to validate the outputs carefully as occasional inaccuracies or fabricated information may still occur.
