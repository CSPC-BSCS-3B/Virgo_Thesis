\thesisAbstract{This study presents the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to enhance literature search and thesis retrieval within the CSPC Library. By integrating advanced natural language processing techniques with a robust retrieval system, the chatbot aims to provide users with efficient access to academic resources. The system leverages large language models (LLMs) to understand user queries and retrieve relevant documents from the library's database. The research outlines the architecture of the RAG chatbot, its implementation, and evaluates its performance in terms of accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction. The findings suggest that the RAG chatbot significantly improves the literature search experience, making it a valuable tool for students and researchers at CSPC. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI-driven information retrieval systems in academic settings.}

    \makeDedication{We, the researchers, dedicate this work to God for giving us wisdom, strength, and perseverance throughout this journey. To our families, whose unconditional love, support, and encouragement have been the foundation of our success, and whose sacrifices and faith in us have made every step possible. To our mentors and instructors, for guiding, challenging, and inspiring us to grow and achieve our goals. To our friends, for their unwavering support, comfort, and laughter, which helped us overcome the challenges along the way. And to our classmates, for sharing this academic journey, offering collaboration, companionship, and memorable experiences that made this chapter meaningful. To all of you who believed in us and supported us in finishing this journey, we sincerely say “thank you.” 
    
    Finally, we dedicate this to ourselves, the researchers, who persevered through every stressful day; despite cramming and being scolded, we have successfully completed this study. We did cram, laugh, struggle, and forget, but we never forgot our goal.\\[1em]
